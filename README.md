# WebKivanc Calendar
WebKivanc is a simple Calendar I built with my friend Daniel in order to explore PHP.

### Sample Usernames for our Calendar

- username: dgrossman password: pass
- username: komeslik password: 123

### Basic Instructions:
- Click on a day to highlight it, then you'll be able to see the events on that day under the calendar. You can add/edit/delete events for that specific day there.
### What we did for Creative Portion
  - Types (Categories) for events: when you add an event, just select one of the categories for your event ( e.g work, academic, social etc. ). Your event will change color according to the type you selected. You can untag your event by selecting "undefined" as the type when you edit the event.
  - An additional input area called notes: which is basically the description for your event.
  - Share event with another user functionality: Click on the share button and type the name of the user that you want to share the event with. When you log in as the other user, you'll be able to see the event on their calendar as well.
  - Repeat event weekly: when you create/edit an event, click on the repeat checkbox to repeat that event every week.
